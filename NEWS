version 0.2
-----------

  * Fixes in command line parsing of bituctl. Now option params
    starting with -- are not interpreted as bitU commands.

  * Improvement of cmdline validation in function
    `bitu_util_extract_params()'. Now it tests the string size before
    anything.

  * Fixed connection problems between local server and bituctl. This
    makes our interactive shell work again! A light clean up was done
    in the shell code too.

  * Readline history enabled on bituctl. Now it remembers last
    commands called. Everything is stored in the `~/.bituctlhistory'
    file.

  * Saving the pid of the main program when starting with a pid file
    configured (via cmd line or config file, both works).

  * Fixing a segfault in `bitu_plugin_ctx_get_list()'.

  * Added/fixed --version and --help options to both bitu and bituctl
    binaries. Their usage() functions were added/improved too.

  * Handling SIGTERM in the main program just like SIGINT.

  * Adding a pkg-config file to the libbitu
