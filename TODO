bitU TODO file
==============

The following entries are *NOT* in order of importance nor in the
order that they will be implemented.

One day, this file will be deleted and these entries will become
tickets in a bts, I hope.

Core
----

 * Implement a loader switch

 * Implement a python loader

   - It would be nice to write a simple python client to be able to
   send stuff to the server via API.

 * Auto accept users that add the bot

   - these users should be stored in a whitelist

   - Maybe this whitelist should be present in the cfg file

   - Maybe this whitelist should come from a ldap directory!

 * Write back configuration set via shell to the config file

 * Write a man page

 * Implement inband registration?

 * Port plugins to other unices?

Plugins
-------

 * Plugin `meminfo'

 * Url shortenning

 * Translation

Ideas
-----

 * Write small programs to monitor services, like a website for
   example. And send messages if the service is down.
