bitU TODO file
==============

The following entries are *NOT* in order of importance nor in the
order that they will be implemented.

One day, this file will be deleted and these entries will become
tickets in a bts, I hope.

 * Change extract_params to read stuff withing "" as a single param

 * Call server commands from bituctl out of the shell via command line

 * Implement a loader switch

 * Implement a python loader

 * Auto accept users that add the bot

   - these users should be stored in a whitelist

   - Maybe this whitelist should be present in the cfg file

 * Implement the log level configuration reading.

   - There should be no needing to restart the bot after this action

 * Save log stuff to a file

   - There are so many things that can be logged, maybe more than one
   file will be needed

 * Write back configuration set via shell to the config file

 * Separate the server_run func in _recv and _send funcs

 * Catch SIGINT and gracefully stop the bot.
